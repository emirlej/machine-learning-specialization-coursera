# Quiz - Assessing performance

### 1. If the features of Model 1 are a strict subset of those in Model 2, the TRAINING error of the two models can never be the same.
Answer: False

### 2. If the features of Model 1 are a strict subset of those in Model 2, which model will USUALLY have lowest TRAINING error?
Answer: Model 2

### 3. If the features of Model 1 are a strict subset of those in Model 2. which model will USUALLY have lowest TEST error?
Answer: Model 2 (Not correct), Model 1 (Not correct), It's impossible to tell with only this information

### 4. If the features of Model 1 are a strict subset of those in Model 2, which model will USUALLY have lower BIAS?
Answer: Model 2

### 5. Which of the following plots of model complexity vs. RSS is most likely from TRAINING data (for a fixed data set)?
Answer: c 

### 6. Which of the following plots of model complexity vs. RSS is most likely from TEST data (for a fixed data set)?
Answer: a

### 7. It is always optimal to add more features to a regression model.
Answer: False

### 8. A simple model with few parameters is most likely to suffer from:
Answer: High bias

### 9. A complex model with many parameters is most likely to suffer from:
Answer: High variance

### 10. A model with many parameters that fits training data very well but does poorly on test data is considered to be
Answer: Overfitted (Not correct), poorly estimated (not correct), biased

### 11. A common process for selecting a parameter like the optimal polynomial degree is:
Answer: Minimizing validation error

### 12: Selecting model complexity on test data (choose all that apply):
Answer: (Not correct)
- Provides an overly optimistic assessment of performance of the resulting model 
- Is computationally inefficient
- Should never be done

Answer: (not correct)
- Allows you to avoid issues of overfitting to training data

Answer:
- Provides an overly optimistic assessment of performance of the resulting model
- Should never be done

### 13: Which of the following statements is true (select all that apply): For a **fixed model complexity**, in the limit of an infinite amount of training data
Answer: (Not correct)
- Bias goes to 0
- Training error goes to 0
- Generalization error goes to 0

Answer:
- Variance goes to 0
